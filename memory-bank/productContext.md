# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

- Developers have a lot of pull requests to manage across multiple repositories.
- They need a one-stop interface to review pull requests, see their status, and interact with them efficiently.
- Collaboration on pull requests can be enhanced with LLMs to provide insights and suggestions, as well as to store conversations related to pull requests.

## Problems It Solves

- **Fragmented Workflow**: Users currently switch between multiple GitHub tabs or repositories, leading to inefficiency.
- **Lack of Context**: Pull requests often lack context, making it hard to understand the history and discussions.
- Users have to juggle multiple projects with different purposes, leading to context switching and inefficiency.

## How It Should Work (High-Level)

- Users can register repositories to monitor pull requests.
- The system automatically tracks active pull requests and displays them in a unified interface.
- Users can navigate directly to specific pull request reviews using a URL pattern.
- The interface should be intuitive, allowing users to quickly access and manage pull requests without complex navigation.
- Users can have conversations with LLMs to get insights on pull requests, propose changes, and store discussions related to pull requests.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide a clean, intuitive interface that minimizes context switching.
- Ensure fast navigation and dynamic updates using Hotwire patterns.

## Business Value

- Streamline pull request management for developers, increasing productivity.
- Enhance collaboration and decision-making through LLM-assisted conversations.
- Reduce toil and improve efficiency in managing pull requests across multiple repositories, speeding up the development process for dependent teams.
