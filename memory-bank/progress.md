# Progress

## What Works

- The memory bank has been successfully initialized with all core documentation files.
- All core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and contain initial boilerplate content.
- The `activeContext.md` file has been updated to reflect the current task and plan for authentication.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement authentication using `rails generate authentication`.
- Create an initial admin user.
- Protect application routes/controllers.
- Integrate OIDC providers (future task).

## Current Status

- Memory bank initialization: Complete.
- Authentication planning: Complete.
- `activeContext.md` updated.

## Known Issues

- None at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial plan to use Devise was revised to use Rails' built-in authentication generator for simplicity and native integration.
