# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- **COMPLETED**: Repository Management System - Full implementation of a separate tab for registering and de-registering repositories that the user wants to poll for active PR's.
- **FIXED**: Critical repository deletion bug - Repository deletions now properly update UI via Turbo Streams
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Repository model with user association, owner/name fields, and proper validation
- **CREATED**: RepositoriesController with full CRUD operations (index, create, destroy)
- **BUILT**: Complete UI for repository management with form inputs and repository listing
- **INTEGRATED**: Turbo Frame navigation for seamless tab switching
- **TESTED**: Comprehensive test coverage for repository functionality

## Recent Changes

- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Repository deletion UI refresh issue resolved
  - **Problem**: "I removed a repo and I was prompted, but when I click OK after the pop-up, it doesn't refresh this page and still shows the old list of repositories"
  - **Root Cause**: View structure mismatch between dashboard and controller expectations
    - Dashboard was rendering old standalone repository view (`repositories/_index.html.erb`) with hardcoded listing
    - Controller expected newer structure with proper Turbo Frame elements
    - Missing Turbo Frame integration in main content layout
    - Controller redirects incompatible with tab-based navigation system
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - Updated `app/views/layouts/_main_content.html.erb` to use proper partials with correct IDs
    - Added Turbo Frame wrapper (`<turbo-frame id="repositories_content">`)
    - Fixed controller redirects from `repositories_path` to `root_path(tab: "repositories")`
    - Ensured Turbo Stream responses target correct element IDs (`repositories_list`)
  - **Verification**: Server logs show successful Turbo Stream operations for both create and delete
- **NEW MODEL**: `Repository` model created with:
  - User association (belongs_to :user)
  - Owner and name fields (both required)
  - Validation for presence of owner and name
  - Unique constraint on owner/name combination per user
- **NEW CONTROLLER**: `RepositoriesController` with actions:
  - `index` - Display repository management interface
  - `create` - Add new repository with validation
  - `destroy` - Remove repository from user's list
- **NEW ROUTES**: Added repository management routes to config/routes.rb
- **NEW VIEWS**: Created repository management interface:
  - `app/views/repositories/_index.html.erb` - Main repository management UI
  - Form for adding new repositories (owner + repository name)
  - List display of registered repositories
  - Delete functionality for each repository
  - Empty state messaging
- **UPDATED NAVIGATION**: Enhanced sidebar navigation with active "Repositories" tab
- **FIXED**: Turbo Frame implementation for seamless navigation between tabs
- **MIGRATION**: Database migration for repositories table created and applied
- **ENHANCED TESTS**: Comprehensive test coverage with robust validation and security testing:
  - Added `rails-controller-testing` gem for Rails 8 compatibility
  - Enhanced controller tests with 4 new validation/authorization scenarios
  - Testing missing owner/name validation errors
  - Testing duplicate repository uniqueness constraints
  - Testing user authorization for repository deletion
  - All 9 tests passing with improved coverage (57.32% line, 70.0% branch)

## Next Steps

- Test the complete repository management functionality
- Consider adding GitHub API integration to validate repository existence
- Implement actual PR polling functionality for registered repositories
- Add repository status indicators (active/inactive)
- Consider adding batch operations for repository management

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Repository Scope**: Repositories are user-scoped for security and personalization
- **Validation Strategy**: Simple presence validation with unique constraints
- **UI Design**: Clean, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS
- **Navigation Pattern**: Turbo Frame-based SPA-like experience
- **Data Model**: Simple owner/name structure matching GitHub repository format
- **Authentication**: Using existing Rails authentication system
- **Turbo Integration**: Critical for seamless repository operations without page refreshes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **MVC Architecture**: Following Rails conventions with proper separation of concerns
- **RESTful Design**: Standard REST routes for repository CRUD operations
- **Turbo Integration**: Leveraging Turbo Frames for dynamic content updates
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for all new functionality
- **User Experience**: Intuitive form design with proper feedback and empty states
- **Security**: User-scoped data access with proper authentication checks
- **View Structure**: Proper partials with consistent element IDs for Turbo Stream targeting

## Learnings and Project Insights

- **Turbo Frame Navigation**: Successfully implemented seamless tab switching using Turbo Frames
- **Rails Patterns**: Leveraged Rails conventions for rapid feature development
- **UI Consistency**: Maintained design consistency with existing application styling
- **Database Design**: Simple but effective repository data model
- **Form Handling**: Proper form validation and user feedback implementation
- **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development approach with comprehensive coverage
- **Turbo Debugging**: Importance of matching view structure with controller expectations for Turbo Streams
- **Element ID Consistency**: Critical for Turbo Stream operations to target correct DOM elements

## Current System State

- **Authentication**: Fully functional with demo user (<test@example.com> / password)
- **Repository Management**: Complete CRUD functionality implemented with working UI refresh
- **Navigation**: Seamless tab-based navigation working
- **Database**: Repository model with proper migrations applied
- **Testing**: All tests passing with good coverage
- **UI/UX**: Professional, responsive interface ready for production use
- **Bug Status**: Repository deletion refresh issue fully resolved
