# System Patterns

## System Architecture

- Describe the overall architecture of the system (e.g., microservices, monolithic, client-server).
- Include diagrams or high-level component interactions if possible.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Document significant technical choices and their justifications (e.g., choice of database, messaging queue, framework).
- Explain the trade-offs considered for each decision.

## Design Patterns in Use

- List and describe common design patterns applied throughout the codebase (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer, MVC).
- Explain where and why these patterns are used.

## Component Relationships

- Detail how different components or modules within the system interact.
- Describe data flow and communication protocols between them.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- Identify and document the most crucial or complex parts of the system's implementation.
- Highlight areas that require careful attention during development or maintenance.
