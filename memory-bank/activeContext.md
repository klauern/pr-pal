# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**✅ COMPLETED**: Implemented tab cleanup when repositories are removed

**NEW FEATURE**: Automatic cleanup of open PR review tabs when a repository is deleted

## Direct URL Navigation Feature - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**URL Pattern**: `http://localhost:3000/repos/:owner/:repo_name/reviews/:pr_number`

**Example**: `http://localhost:3000/repos/klauern/openai-orgs/reviews/3`

### Implementation Details

1. **New Route**: Added `get "repos/:repo_owner/:repo_name/reviews/:pr_number"` route
2. **New Controller Action**: `PullRequestReviewsController#show_by_details`
