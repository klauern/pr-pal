# Progress

## What Works ✅

- **Authentication System**: Demo user (`test@example.com` / `password`)
- **Simplified Navigation**: Standard Turbo Drive for all main tab switching
- **Repository Management**: Full CRUD with proper Turbo Stream updates
- **Clean Architecture**: Removed complex nested Turbo Frame structure
- **Database Schema**: All tables and relationships working
- **Consistent Patterns**: Single approach to Turbo usage throughout app
- **PR Tab System**: Session-based PR review tabs in sidebar with close functionality
- **Direct URL Navigation**: `/repos/:owner/:repo_name/reviews/:pr_number` pattern with auto-registration

## What Was Fixed

- **Navigation Issues**: Replaced complex Turbo Frame targeting with standard Turbo Drive
- **Authentication Context**: Current.user now works consistently across all requests
- **Repository CRUD**: Forms use Turbo Streams for seamless updates
- **Code Simplicity**: Eliminated conflicting Turbo patterns
- **PR Tab Management**: Added session-based tracking for opened PR reviews

## Current Status

**✅ REFACTORING COMPLETE**: Consistent Hotwire strategy successfully implemented with PR tab functionality

## Architecture

- **Primary Navigation**: Turbo Drive handles sidebar tab switching with full page loads
- **Dynamic Updates**: Turbo Streams handle form submissions and list updates
- **Simple Layout**: Clean sidebar + main content without nested frames
- **Standard Rails**: Conventional controller actions and view rendering
- **PR Tab System**: Session-based tracking with automatic cleanup and limits

## PR Tab Features

- **Auto-Add on Open**: Opening a PR review automatically adds it to sidebar tabs
- **Tab Switching**: Click between multiple open PR reviews without returning to main list
- **Close Buttons**: Individual × buttons to close specific PR tabs
- **Smart Limiting**: Keeps only last 5 opened tabs to prevent sidebar clutter
- **Session Persistence**: Tabs persist across page reloads
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Tabs removed when PR reviews are deleted or completed

## Next Development Phase

With stable foundation and complete tab system now in place:

1. **GitHub API Integration**: Connect to GitHub for real repository data
2. **PR Monitoring**: Background jobs to fetch active pull requests
3. **Enhanced UI**: Improve repository status indicators and management
4. **LLM Integration**: Enhance conversation features for PR reviews
