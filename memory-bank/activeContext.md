# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Implementing authentication for the Rails application using the built-in `rails generate authentication` command.
- Setting up an initial admin user for testing.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized memory bank with core documentation files.
- Decided to use Rails' built-in authentication generator instead of Devise for a simpler starting point and better alignment with Rails conventions.

## Next Steps

- Run `rails generate authentication`.
- Run `rails db:migrate`.
- Create an initial admin user.
- Protect application routes/controllers.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The initial authentication will be a simple user/password system.
- Future work will involve integrating OIDC providers like Auth0 or Okta on top of this foundation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Prioritizing Rails-native solutions where possible.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Rails 8.0+ includes a robust built-in authentication generator, simplifying initial setup.
