# Testing Discipline Rule

- **Tests must be run every time work is done.**
- **Never leave work in progress with failing tests.**
- All new features, bug fixes, and refactors must be accompanied by passing tests before considering the work complete.
- If a test fails, fix the code or the test before proceeding with further development or committing changes.
- This rule applies to all contributors and all parts of the codebase.
