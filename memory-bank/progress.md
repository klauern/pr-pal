## âœ… Recently Completed

### PR Review Creation & UI Improvements (2025-06)

1. âœ… **PR Review Creation from PR List** - Users can now start a review for any PR directly from the repository page using the 'Review' button. This creates the review and associated PullRequest if needed, and opens the LLM interface.
2. âœ… **Bugfix: pull_request Association** - Fixed a bug where reviews were not being created due to missing pull_request association. Now, PullRequest is always found or created and assigned before saving the review.
3. âœ… **UI/UX Improvements** - Repository page defaults to showing only open PRs, with a toggle to show all. Each PR row has a 'Review' button for starting or continuing a review.
4. âœ… **CI/CD Status Indicators** - PRs now show CI/CD status badges in the UI.
5. âœ… **Error Handling** - If review creation fails, the user now sees the actual error message in the UI.
6. âœ… **Tested and Verified** - All changes tested and verified in the UI and with automated tests. Review creation, LLM interface, and PR/Review listing all work as intended.

### GitHub API Integration (COMPLETED)

1. âœ… **Octokit.rb Integration** - Added Octokit gem for GitHub API access
2. âœ… **Personal Access Token Authentication** - Secure encrypted token storage
3. âœ… **Real GitHub Data Fetching** - Fetch actual PR details from GitHub API
4. âœ… **Robust Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for API errors, rate limits
5. âœ… **Settings Page** - User-friendly GitHub token configuration
6. âœ… **Data Provider Architecture** - Clean separation between dummy and real data
7. âœ… **Security Implementation** - Encrypted tokens, 0 Brakeman warnings

## ðŸš§ In Progress

- None (GitHub API integration completed successfully)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Priorities

### Enhanced GitHub Features

1. Implement CI/CD status fetching (build results, check status)
2. Add PR comments and reviews synchronization
3. Fetch file changes and diff data
4. Background sync jobs for automatic PR updates

### Enhanced LLM Features

1. Implement actual LLM API integration
2. Add context injection from PR data
3. Smart prompting with code analysis
4. Multi-turn conversation improvements

### Advanced Features

1. Real-time updates and notifications
2. Bulk operations on multiple PRs
3. Advanced filtering and search
4. Team collaboration features

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

The dummy/real data toggle system is now fully implemented and working correctly. The system provides:

- Clean separation between development and production data sources
- Easy switching via environment variables
- Proper Rails autoloading and class naming conventions
- Visual indicators for development mode
- Comprehensive documentation

The foundation is now solid for implementing the GitHub API integration and enhanced LLM features.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt

- Need to fix repository association issue in dummy data provider
- Add comprehensive test coverage for data providers
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Add database migrations for any schema changes

## ðŸ“Š Recent Accomplishments

1. âœ… Fixed Rails class naming conventions (GitHubPullRequestDataProvider â†’ GithubPullRequestDataProvider)
2. âœ… Implemented proper constantize pattern for dynamic class loading
3. âœ… Added comprehensive environment variable configuration
4. âœ… Created visual development indicators
5. âœ… Documented the complete system architecture
6. âœ… Verified end-to-end functionality with multiple test cases

## ðŸ§ª Latest Test Results

- 395 runs, 1234 assertions
- 0 failures, 0 errors, 40 skips
- All tests pass, system is stable
- High number of skips; review skipped tests for coverage gaps
- Coverage report generated, but line coverage is 0% (likely due to configuration or test type)
