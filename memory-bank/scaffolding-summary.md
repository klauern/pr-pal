# Pull Request Review Scaffolding - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Models

- **PullRequestReview**: Manages individual PR review sessions with user association, GitHub PR details, status tracking, and LLM context
- **LlmConversationMessage**: Stores conversation history between user and LLMs with proper ordering and metadata

### 2. Controllers

- **PullRequestReviewsController**: Handles CRUD operations for PR reviews, including marking as complete
- **LlmConversationMessagesController**: Manages adding new messages to conversations

### 3. Views and UI

- **PR Reviews Tab**: New sidebar navigation item for accessing active reviews
- **Review List**: Shows all "in progress" PR reviews with metadata and action buttons
- **Review Pane**: Slide-in panel for individual PR review with:
  - PR header with link to GitHub
  - Editable context summary
  - Conversation history display
  - Message input form
  - Close and "Mark Complete" buttons

### 4. Key Features Implemented

- **Session State Persistence**: Reviews are saved to database and persist across sessions
- **Auto-close on Completion**: When marked complete, reviews are automatically closed and removed from active list
- **Turbo Frame Integration**: Seamless navigation and real-time updates
- **Conversation Threading**: Proper message ordering and display
- **User Scoping**: All data is properly scoped to authenticated users

### 5. Navigation Flow

1. User clicks "PR Reviews" in sidebar
2. Sees list of active (in_progress) reviews
3. Clicks "Open Review" to slide in review pane
4. Can view conversation history and add new messages
5. Can edit context summary for better LLM interactions
6. Can close pane or mark review as complete

### 6. Data Structure

```
User
├── PullRequestReviews (in_progress/completed)
│   ├── Repository association
│   ├── GitHub PR metadata (ID, URL, title)
│   ├── LLM context summary
│   └── LlmConversationMessages
│       ├── User messages
│       └── LLM responses (with model/token info)
```

### 7. Demo Data

- Created seed file with sample PR reviews and conversations
- Demo user (<test@example.com> / password) has 2 active reviews with conversation history

## Ready for Next Steps

The scaffolding is complete and ready for:

1. GitHub API integration to fetch real PR data
2. LLM integration to generate actual responses
3. Background job processing for PR monitoring
4. Enhanced review management features

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- Models have proper validations and relationships
- Controllers handle authentication and authorization
- Fixtures created for testing new functionality

The foundation is solid and extensible for building the full PR review system.
